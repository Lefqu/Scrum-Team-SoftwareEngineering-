The most up-to-date version of the game with a new torpedo weapon type.
The new weapon attacks an entire line of the enemies battlefield, shooting cells one by one from left to right until a ship is hit.
This version of the game also implements a new interface feature, which is an opportunity for the player to open their arsenal -- the menu of weapons available.
